# JBShell (Go)

["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

In this challenge (taken from CodeCrafters), I'm building my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and these builtin commands:
* type
* cd
* pwd
* echo
* exit

So far, I've learned about shell command parsing, REPLs and how these fundamental linux builtins work.

Thank you to [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) for breaking this project up into managable steps.
